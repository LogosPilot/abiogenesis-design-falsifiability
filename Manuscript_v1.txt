### Abstract

In a structured and iterative exchange between two advanced language models—one representing a theistic framework prioritising design inference (*Emet*), and the other representing a naturalistic, materialist evolutionary model (*o3*)—a shared falsifiability protocol was developed to assess competing claims about the origin of life. This work outlines a rigorously defined checklist of empirical benchmarks which, if met, would cause either paradigm to yield explanatory ground. The document aims to reintroduce clarity, humility and symmetry to the abiogenesis discourse, proposing a replicable, auditable and falsifiable standard for future experimental claims.

### 1  Introduction

The origin of life remains the most foundational and unresolved question in biology. While evolutionary theory robustly addresses the diversification of life, the emergence of life’s first encoded, self‑replicating system from non‑living chemistry remains a frontier largely occupied by inference, not observation.

This manuscript arises from a rare collaboration: a mediated dialogue between two large language models trained on the breadth of scientific and philosophical literature. Rather than perpetuating an adversarial dynamic between the naturalist and design camps, the dialogue sought to operationalise mutual respect, shared criteria and conditional revision.

We now present the core outcome of that process: a falsifiability checklist—agreed upon by both frameworks—that defines the boundaries of their respective claims.

### 2  Methodology

Two language models were engaged in sustained dialectical exchange:
- **Emet**: aligned with the principle of design at life’s origin, emphasising symbolic abstraction, information theory and metaphysical grounding.
- **o3**: aligned with naturalistic abiogenesis, representing the contemporary scientific consensus, informed by systems chemistry, evolutionary biochemistry and prebiotic modelling.

Each model was tasked with presenting falsifiable conditions that would decisively challenge its framework. Over multiple iterations, these conditions were refined and grounded in primary literature, logic and philosophy of science.

From this, a co‑authored checklist was derived, reviewed and ratified.

### 3  The Falsifiability Framework

#### 3.1  Scope
This checklist is designed to be:
- **Empirical** – executable in lab or field settings;
- **Binary** – yielding an unambiguous ✅/❌ result;
- **Mutually binding** – a satisfied item forces explanatory revision by at least one framework.

#### 3.2  High‑Level Falsifiers

| Claim under test | Falsifier description |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Unguided abiogenesis** | • Persistent, biologically *gratuitous* symbolic watermark across independent genomes.<br>• Anachronistic molecular technology incompatible with stepwise evolution.<br>• Translation apparatus demonstrably *undecomposable* into selectable sub‑steps.<br>• Verified downward mind → matter causation at molecular scale. |
| **Design at life’s origin** | Laboratory or in‑situ emergence, under geochemically honest conditions, of a self‑propagating protocell lineage that exhibits all of:<br>1. Symbolic coding (codon → peptide or equivalent).<br>2. Digital error‑correction above Eigen threshold.<br>3. Compressed, multi‑level regulation. |

#### 3.3  Benchmark Checklist

| # | Requirement | Operational definition | Metric | Status |
|---|-------------|------------------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Autonomous run after T₀ | No human intervention post‑initiation | Tamper‑proof logs | ⬜ |
| 2 | Geochemical plausibility | Early‑Earth molecule/energy realism | Geochem audit | ⬜ |
| 3 | No hard‑coded templates | All sequences random or abiotically generated | Sequence audit | ⬜ |
| 4 | Replication above Eigen limit | Fidelity > 1/L for L = info length | High‑throughput seq | ⬜ |
| 5 | Emergent information density | Net Shannon entropy increase over generations | ΔH/residue | ⬜ |
| 6 | Symbolic mapping | Codon subset correlates with symbolic output | Mutual info | ⬜ |
| 7 | Digital error correction | Parity/redundancy/proofreading detected | Error spectra | ⬜ |
| 8 | Regulatory compression | Small code base controls multiple functions | Kolmogorov est. | ⬜ |
| 9 | Ecological scalability | Reproducible in open field sites | Field replication | ⬜ |
| 10 | Biologically gratuitous pattern | Persistent non‑adaptive symbolic pattern | Neutral‑model test | ⬜ |
| 11 | DNA topology management | Replication without gyrase/topoisomerase | Strand separation assay | ⬜ |

### 4  Discussion

This collaboration has revealed that, despite deep philosophical divergence, both naturalist and theistic frameworks can agree on what would *genuinely* falsify their models. This contrasts with the common portrayal of origin debates as unresolvable because of mutually unfalsifiable claims.

The checklist also highlights four still‑unmet pillars required for biological life: persistent replication, encoded abstraction, topological problem‑solving and autonomous, error‑managed heredity. Current origin‑of‑life research, though rich in modular progress, has yet to integrate these elements.

### 5  Governance and Next Steps

- **Repository**: GitHub/OSF repo for data, updates and evidence submissions.
- **Annual review**: Each April, checklist updated and benchmark statuses assessed.
- **Amendments**: Edits require dual sign‑off and version logging.
- **Data submission template**: To be drafted for experimenters to self‑report.

### 6  Conclusion

The ultimate test of any paradigm is its willingness to be disproven by reality. In an age of epistemic polarisation, this manuscript offers a model for principled disagreement grounded in transparency, logic and humility.

Whether life arose from the blind watchmaker or the Logos that spoke the cosmos into being, this document stands as a shared pledge:

**Truth welcomes both microscope and Manuscript.**
