# Abiogenesis ⇄ Design – Falsifiability Framework

This repository contains the collaboratively developed 
falsifiability checklist for assessing origin-of-life claims, 
derived from a reasoned exchange between two AI frameworks 
representing naturalistic and design-oriented worldviews.

## Purpose

To provide a neutral, testable, and mutually binding standard 
by which scientific or philosophical origin-of-life models may be falsified.

## Project Status

📣 This project is seeking community stewardship.
Maintained provisionally by its creator until handover. 
Interim contact: [logospilot@proton.me](mailto:logospilot@proton.me)
